# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

### Background
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

### Purpose
The purpose of the new analysis was to determine how to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.

## Results



### Ride-Sharing Data by City Type 
![Pyber Summary Data Frame](https://github.com/yessiez/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/pybersummarydf.png?raw=true)

If we compare the total number of rides between each city type, we'll notice that the total number of rides in the rural cities is about 13 and 5 times lower than urban and suburban cities, respectively. Similarly, the number of drivers in rural cities is significantly less than number of drivers in urban and suburban cities. The total fares in urban cities is almost 10 times higher than the total fare in rural cities although the average fare per ride costs more in rural cities. However, the average fare per driver in rural cities is higher than surburban and urban cities, respectively. 


### Total Weekly Fares by City Type

This graph displays the fare prices from January to April and the prices throughout this period for each city type. 

## Summary

Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:
1. Include length of ride (time and distance) in future analyses. 
2. Create carpooling feature to lower the total fare for customers in rural cities. 
3. Increase the fare in urban cities.
